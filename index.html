<h2>A1</h2>
<pre>
var getGrade = function(quiz)
 {
    return quiz.grade;
 }
var answer=getGrade;
</pre>
<p>This function takes in a quiz object and retturns the value of its grade attribute.</p>

<h2>A2</h2>
<pre>
var answer= d3.mean(classroom[0].quizes.map(getGrade));
</pre>
<p>This code retrieves the first penguin, accesses its quizes, then maps those quizes into an array
 of quiz grades. Finally, the mean of those grades is stored in the variable "answer".  
 </p>
 
 <h2>A3</h2>
 <pre>
  var penguinQuizMean=function(penguin)
   {
    return d3.mean(penguin.quizes, getGrade);
   };
 </pre>
 <p>This function takes a single penguin as a parameter. It accesses that penguin's quizes then maps
  them into an array of that penguin's quiz grades. Finally, the mean of those grades is returned. 
 </p>
 
 <h2>A4</h2>
 <pre>
 var means = classroom.map(penguinQuizMean);
 </pre>
 <p>This code maps classroom (an array of penguin objects) into an array of those penguins' quiz means,
  via the penguinQuizMean function that we wrote for A3. This was a difficult problem, but once we 
  got a grip on mapping we were able to get it.
 </p>
 
 <h2>A5</h2>
 <pre>
 var classMean = d3.mean(classroom.map(penguinQuizMean));
 </pre>
 <p>This problem adds one more aspect to A4. Once the array of quiz means has been created by that code,
  we use d3.mean() to average the values in that array into a single class mean.
